# 👋 Welcome — I'm Taras Khamardiuk (aka Kay aka TK51)

**Technical Solutions Designer** and **Systems Strategist**  
Diagnosing decay. Designing clarity. Engineering structure from field friction.

## 🛠️ What I Actually Do

- Officially: Crime Analyst.  
- Actually: A platform-minded builder who sees where systems break, and wires them back up.
- I **convert messy realities into structured logic**, whether through data, UX teardown, or architecture mapping.
- I don't chase tools — I chase why things fail, and **engineer grounded alternatives**.
- I **reduce click-debt** through **modular scripting** and **reproducible workflows** that scale without micromanagement.

---

## 🔂 From Field Insight to Engineered Signal

- I **tabulate and monitor** lived systems, then reverse-engineer usable features from them.  
- My experience comes from **putting life into data**, not dressing dashboards after the fact.  
- I've modeled platform behavior and UX friction entirely inside Sheets — because clarity doesn’t require a license.  
- I don’t mistake **tools for skills**. Power BI, ArcGIS, Looker, Tableau — all just instruments, not identities.  
- My strength is seeing **systemic co-relations**, tracing **root causes**, and applying **Kaizen-style refinements** that reduce invisible waste.

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Vanity Design Philosophy

- I’m **not okay** with solutions where **creators win but users lose**.  
- UX without logic is just decoration.  
- I question systems where polish beats clarity.  
- I stand for **user-centered infrastructure**, not portfolio-centered inventions.

## 📍 Current Technical Focus

- Designing **failure-resistant** logic layers  
- Re-architecting **signal flow** across BI, UX, civic tech, and infrastructure  
- Building **traceable workflows** and **self-validating structures**  
- Injecting **real-world correction** into the overly polished tech landscape

## 🔋 Personal Verticals

1. **Automotive + EV**: Interface logic, drive experience, spatial dynamics  
2. **Tech UX**: Systems that work the first time, not after 5 updates  
3. **Civic + Healthcare Systems**: Where inefficiency hurts the most  
4. **Data Translation Layers**: Turning life into structure, then action

---

## 🔧 Tooling (Not Identity)

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **BI Tools**: Power BI, Excel, Tableau, Looker  
- **GIS + Workflow**: ArcGIS Pro, Google Sheets, MS Access  
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub, automation pipelines, custom UX logic  
- **Modality**: From no-code scaffolds to full-scripted platforms — based on what the system needs

## 📄 Certifications

🧾 [Credly Badge Vault →](https://www.credly.com/users/taras-khamardiuk/badges#)  
(Yes, they’re real. But more real? I’ve used them to build systems that don’t collapse — unlike most slide decks.)

## 🧭 Career Locked

**Now**: Technical Solutions Designer / System Architect / Automotive UX Strategist  
**Before**: BI & Automation Specialist, Data-Focused Analyst  
**Next**: Platform refactorer. System troublemaker. Infrastructure corrector.

## 🤝 Let’s (Maybe) Connect

If you think good UX is color schemes, skip me.  
If you think structured backend leads to better experiences, maybe we should talk.  
Not seeking attention — just building in public what should’ve worked by default.  
I’m not building for hype. I’m building for people who’ll care later.
