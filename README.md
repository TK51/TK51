# x_X Welcome — I'm Taras Khamardiuk (aka Kay / TK51)

**Business Data Analyst** by alignment.  
*Technical Solutions Designer* by instinct.  
System operator built from friction — not theory.

### x_X What I Actually Do

Official: BDA / Crime Analyst  
Actual: I translate field dysfunction into structured logic.  
Using Python, Excel, teardown workflows, and behavior-aware scripting.  
Not tool-centered — failure-pattern centered.  
Most of what I work on wasn’t broken loudly — just neglected until it mattered.

---

### x_X Pattern Work

I observe where friction lives — in forms, flows, overlooked steps.  
Then I map what breaks, trace to repeat logic, and patch it:  
automation, teardown, deletion, or reframing.  
Quiet fixes. Durable outcomes.

---

### x_X From UX Wounds to Working Systems

I rebuild civic workflows, reporting pipelines, clinical forms.  
Sometimes I delete 27 useless steps. Sometimes I script.  
Dashboards ≠ delivery.  
Reporting is structure — not aesthetic.

---

### x_X Anti-Vanity Design

Too many “polished” apps collapse in the real world.  
If your platform fails under pressure, I’ll find it.  
I don’t chase polish. I deliver logic that doesn’t need retraining.

---

### x_X Tooling (Still Just Tools)

**Languages**: Python (pandas, openpyxl), SQL, R (used tactically)  
**BI Tools**: Excel (pivot logic + automation), Power BI, Tableau, Looker  
**Ops/GIS**: ArcGIS Pro, MS Access, Outlook scripting, Sheets  
**Infra**: GitHub, automation pipelines, modular logic  
**Modality**: No-code, low-code, script — I use what fits the fracture

(Yes, I have badges. But more importantly — I build systems that don’t ghost users.)

### x_X Runtime & Contact

Now: Reporting Automation Specialist / Business Data Analyst  
Always: Logic builder with TSD instincts  
Next: Data Systems Operator. UX debugger. Pipeline stabilizer.

If polish matters more than flow — I’m not your guy.  
If you want pipelines that don’t collapse — maybe we talk.
