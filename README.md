# 👋 Welcome — I'm Taras Khamardiuk (aka Kay aka TK51)

**Business Data Analyst** by alignment.  
**Technical Solutions Designer** by instinct.  
A system operator born from friction — not theory.

## 🛠️ What I Actually Do

- Officially: Crime Analyst.  
- Actually: I wire broken reporting systems back into signal flow.  
- I **translate field dysfunction into structured logic**, using data, UX teardown, and automation workflows.  
- I don’t build around tools — I build around failure patterns.  
- My job is to stabilize what others abandoned — **via scripting, logic repair, and behavioral insight**.

---

## 🔂 From UX Wounds to Working Systems

- I **observe live environments**, extract logic, and engineer corrections.  
- That means reporting pipelines, civic workflows, clinical forms — all the stuff that breaks quietly.  
- Sometimes I fix it in Python. Sometimes in Excel. Sometimes by deleting 27 useless steps.  
- I don’t confuse **dashboards with delivery**. Reporting is a structure — not a look.

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Vanity Design (Still Unapologetic)

- I still refuse UX where creators win and users lose.  
- I’ve seen too many “polished” apps fail in real workflows.  
- If your platform has 12 features and only 3 work under stress — I’ll find them.  
- I’m not chasing hype. I’m chasing **stability** — the kind you don’t have to re-train for.

---

## 📍 Current Tactical Focus

- Building **resilient BI/reporting workflows** across civic + clinical + operational fields  
- Automating failure-prone logic using **Python + Excel + field signals**  
- Rewriting **data stories into reproducible reports**, not one-off visuals  
- Injecting clarity into backend decisions — **even when no one’s watching**

---

## 🔋 Personal Signal Zones

1. **EV & Automotive**: UX from the wheel, not from the spec sheet  
2. **Operational BI**: Systems that handle pressure — not pitch decks  
3. **Civic & Clinical Ops**: Where delays and error cost lives  
4. **Data + Form Logic**: Turning forms into structured pipelines

---

## 🔧 Tooling (Still Just Tools)

- **Languages**: Python (pandas, openpyxl), SQL, R (trully amazing thing, using rarely)  
- **BI Tools**: Excel (pivot logic + scripting), Power BI, Tableau, Looker  
- **Workflow/GIS**: ArcGIS Pro, MS Access, Outlook scripting, Sheets  
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub, process pipelines, automation frameworks  
- **Modality**: No-code, low-code, full script — I use what fits the fracture

## 📄 Certs & Proofs

🧾 [Credly Badge Vault →](https://www.credly.com/users/taras-khamardiuk/badges#)  
(Yeah, I’ve got badges. But more importantly — **I’ve built systems that don’t ghost their users**.)

## 🧭 Career Runtime

**Now**: Reporting Automation Specialist / Business Data Analyst  
**Always**: Systems-thinker with TSD/SA instincts  
**Next**: Data Systems Operator. UX debugger. Pipeline stabilizer.

---

## 🤝 Let’s Connect (If It’s Real)

If you value polish over logic, I’m not for you.  
If you want **reporting pipelines that don’t collapse**, then maybe we talk.  
Not trying to trend — just trying to deliver **the work no one else likes to touch**.
